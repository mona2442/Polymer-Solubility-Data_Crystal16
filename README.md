# Polymer-Solubility-Data_Crystal16
This is the processed data (cooling cycle) which has been used for solubility modeling of the polymer-solvent systems using Crystal16 turbidity measurements. Data in `crystal16_data.csv` corresponds with processed solubility data generated from our raw solubility data. This data is provided in the [Unprocessed_Data](./Unprocessed_Data/) folder, along with a README explaining how to process the data.
